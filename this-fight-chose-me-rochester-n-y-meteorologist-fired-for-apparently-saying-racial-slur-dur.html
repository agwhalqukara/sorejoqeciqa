<time>11 Sep 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>After the mayor called for his firing, a Rochester, N.Y. meteorologist has been terminated from his position at a local news station after viewers became upset when he uttered a racial slur during a weather report.</p><p>Jeremy Kappell, who worked for&nbsp;WHEC, was reporting a story about an ice rink at Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Park Friday, Jan. 4 when he said, “Martin Luther Coon — King Jr. — Park.”</p><p>The report was captured by a viewer on Facebook and went viral, prompting an outpouring of outrage from those watching.</p><p>Rochester's WHEC Channel 10 decided to slip a little racist reference to Dr King in close to his birthday. This aired 1/4/19 @ aproximately 5:30 pmListen as the newscaster decides that Martin Luther King should be referred to as Martin Luther Coon King and keeps it moving the other day. I have already asked for an explanation from WHEC about this:</p><p>Posted by <a href=# role=button>Alan Majors</a> on Saturday, January 5, 2019</p><p>“So disgusting and sad; on the slight chance it was a fraudien slip it ‘still’ speaks of what he’s really thinking. Please keep us posted on the outcome.”</p><p>“This is awful for real<span class=_5mfr><span class=_6qdm>😡.”</span></span></p><p>Included in those blasting the utterance is the city’s mayor.</p><p>Mayor Lovely Warren, Council President Loretta C. Scott and the Rochester City Council issued a statement over the matter Jan. 6 calling on the NBC station to fire Kappell.</p><p>“It is wrong, hurtful and infuriating that WHEC Channel 10 broadcast a racial slur in reference to Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. during its Friday News broadcast,” the statement read. “It is beyond unacceptable that this occurred. There must be real consequences for the news personality involved and also for the management team that failed to immediately apologize and address the slur.</p><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-477254 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/atlantablackstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/cH-GTKOu_400x400-300x300.jpg alt="jeremy kappell" width=300 height=300 sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p id=caption-attachment-477254 class=wp-caption-text>Mayor Lovely Warren expressed disappointment in how long it took the station to respond to Jeremy Kappell’s remarks. (@LovelyWarrenRoc/Twitter)</p><p>“The individual responsible for the slur should no longer be employed at Channel 10. But, there is a larger issue here,” the memo went on. “An issue that is exemplified by the response of management at Channel 10. It took the station nearly two days to apologize, and only after the station was shamed into doing so by a backlash on social media.”</p><p>By Monday morning, the station’s vice president and general manager&nbsp;Richard A. Reingold issued a statement confirming that Kappell had been fired following a staffing change Sunday and an immediate investigation.</p><p>“We believe strongly in holding our reporters and anchors to the highest standard. We are proud of our dedicated newsroom professionals and expect and require that each respects and understands that their behavior reflects directly on the station for which they work and the community we serve.</p><p>“These words have no place on News10NBC’s air, and the fact that we broadcast them disheartens and disgusts me; that it was not caught immediately is inexcusable. I regret that we did not immediately interrupt our broadcast and apologize on the spot,” Reingold said.</p><p>On Twitter Monday morning, Kappell said, “For the record, I’ve never uttered those words in my life.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/atlantablackstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/jeremy-kappell.png alt="jeremy kappell" width=478 height=234 sizes="(max-width: 478px) 100vw, 478px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>“I’m my mind I knew I mispronounced but there was no malice nothing that I could’ve … I had no idea the way it came across to many people,” Kappell remarked in a Facebook video <a href=# rel=noopener>uploaded</a> Monday evening. “That is not a word I said I promise you that. If you did feel that it hurt you in any way in any way I sincerely apologize. I would never want to tarnish the reputation of a such a great man as Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., one of the greatest civic leaders of all time.”</p><p>The former NBC affiliate weatherman spoke about what he experienced on&nbsp;Radio 95.1 Jan. 8.</p><p>“It was tumultuous, it was one of the worst days in my life,” Kappell, who said his report was “mischaracterized,” explains at around the 2:00 mark after noting he received lots of support by Monday morning.</p><p>“Although I didn’t choose this fight, this fight chose me. And now, it’s time for us to run with this,” he added of his plans for taking possible legal action.</p><p>He also said he is “extremely disappointed” that the mayor did not reach out to him before she “cast judgment.”</p><p>He was fired over an alleged racial slur, former Channel 10 meteorologist Jeremy Kappell joins The Wease Show.</p><p>Posted by <a href=#>Radio 95.1</a> on Tuesday, January 8, 2019</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZpKGur8DAm6Oam5uowaK%2BjZympmdiZX56e49qZmlwX6m1qr%2BMn6CgoKRisKm70p5kpp1dp7yktMSsq56qXaN6unnMnquep6KkubCzyKyrZp6Zp7KlecWoqWaZoKWus7HNraOyZaOWxqq6xmapmpuZlrluv8uuqWacpae2r7OMq5ypp6KperS8xJqirGWfqsFw</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthis-fight-chose-me-rochester-n-y-meteorologist-fired-for-apparently-saying-racial-slur-dur.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fthis-fight-chose-me-rochester-n-y-meteorologist-fired-for-apparently-saying-racial-slur-dur.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fthis-fight-chose-me-rochester-n-y-meteorologist-fired-for-apparently-saying-racial-slur-dur.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fthis-fight-chose-me-rochester-n-y-meteorologist-fired-for-apparently-saying-racial-slur-dur.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthis-fight-chose-me-rochester-n-y-meteorologist-fired-for-apparently-saying-racial-slur-dur.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthis-fight-chose-me-rochester-n-y-meteorologist-fired-for-apparently-saying-racial-slur-dur.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./usher-gives-playful-reaction-to-cutesy-toddler-lip-syncing-netizens-love-her-passion-she-s-co.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./usher-gives-playful-reaction-to-cutesy-toddler-lip-syncing-netizens-love-her-passion-she-s-co.html>Usher Gives Playful Reaction to Cutesy Toddler Lip-Syncing, Netizens Love Her Passion: Shes Co</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./drop-fade.html>Drop Fade</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./drop-fade.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
