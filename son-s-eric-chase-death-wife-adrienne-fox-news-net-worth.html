He is one of the most successful political and financial analysts, though his career has been marred by a number of controversies.</p><p>So, do you want to find out more about Eric Bolling, from his childhood to most recent career endeavors, then interesting events from his life and not so happy situations? If yes, then stay with us as we are about to bring you closer to this prominent television personality.</p><h2><span id=What_Happened_to_Eric_Bolling>What Happened to Eric Bolling?</span></h2><p>Eric and Fox News Channel <a rel=nofollow href=#>parted their ways amicably</a> in September 2017, apparently because of a number of accusations against Eric that he sexually harassed a number of his female colleagues. One of those women was Caroline Heldman, who came out about Eric’s numerous unwanted sexual advances towards her. All may have remained secret if it wasn’t for freelance writer Yashar Ali, who sold the story to The Huffington Post, in regards to Bolling’s alleged inappropriate comments and lewd text messages sent to female colleagues. Eric subsequently sued Ali for $50 million, however, no further details are available about the result of this lawsuit.</p><p></p><h2><span id=Eric_Bolling_Wiki_Early_Life_Parents_and_Education>Eric Bolling Wiki: Early Life, Parents, and Education</span></h2><p>Born to John Gustav Bolling and Marie Hildegarde, Eric grew up with two sisters, however, one of them lost her life to cancer, and years later his mother also passed away from the same disease. He was educated at Loyola Academy, and after matriculation enrolled at Rollins College, graduating with a BA degree in economics, and then continued his education by obtaining a fellowship to Duke University’s School of Public Policy. While at Rollins College, Eric was a part of the baseball team, and upon his graduation, he was drafted by the Pittsburgh Pirates, and played a couple years in the minor leagues, before he had to quit his career due to a torn rotator cuff injury.</p><h2><span id=Career_Beginnings>Career Beginnings</span></h2><p>He joined New York Mercantile Exchange, and started a specialization in the crude oil, gold and agricultural commodities trading sector. He rose to prominence as a trader through success, and eventually assumed the position of a strategic advisor, and served on the Board of Directors for five years as well. During his years as a trader, Eric scooped several prestigious awards, including the Maybach Man of the Year Award in 2007, while in 2005 and 2006 he was named in the top 100 traders by Trader Monthly. He was offered a position at CBS to work with them on the new show “Fast Money”, which premiered in 2006 with Eric as the first host of the show. However, he remained there only for a year before he joined Fox News.</p><p lang=und dir=ltr><a rel=nofollow href=#>pic.twitter.com/i9CHPW2va9</a></p><p>— Eric Bolling??

During this time he made a contribution to other shows too, such as “Fox and Friends” (2012-2016), “Outnumbered” (2014-2017), and “The Fox News Specialists” in 2017.</p><p></p><p>All these added-up to Eric becoming an extremely successful television host, and upon his leaving, it became quite easy for him to find a new engagement, and he <a rel=nofollow href=#>joined CRTV</a> and was given his own show – “America with Eric Bolling” – which premiered on the 4th July 2018.</p><h2><span id=An_Accomplished_Author>An Accomplished Author</span></h2><p>Eric has also spread his ideas and thoughts through books; his first publication “Wake Up America”, came out in 2016, and became a New York Times bestseller. The following year, Eric published his second book, entitled “The Swamp: Washington’s Murky Pool of Corruption and Cronyism and How Trump Can Drain It”. The sales of the books have also contributed to his wealth.</p><h2><span id=Eric_Bolling_Net_Worth>Eric Bolling Net Worth</span></h2><p>So, have you ever wondered how rich Eric Bolling is, as of late 2018? According to authoritative sources, it has been estimated that Bolling’s net worth is as high as $25 million, while his annual income when he was at Fox News was around $3 million.
