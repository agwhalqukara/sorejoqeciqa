Some of his most notable powers are:</p><ul><li>Sharingan: The Sharingan is a dojutsu (eye technique) that grants its user enhanced perception, analytical skills, and memory. It also allows its user to copy other ninja’s techniques and cast powerful illusions called genjutsu. Itachi’s Sharingan was so advanced that he could use it with minimal eye strain and activate it at will.</li><li>Mangekyo Sharingan: The Mangekyo Sharingan is an evolved form of the Sharingan that grants its user access to new and more potent abilities. However, it also causes its user to gradually lose their eyesight. Itachi’s Mangekyo Sharingan had two unique abilities: Amaterasu and Tsukuyomi.<ul><li>Amaterasu: Amaterasu is a fire technique that creates black flames that can burn anything they touch. The flames are said to be as hot as the sun and can only be extinguished by Itachi or someone who has his eyes.</li><li>Tsukuyomi: Tsukuyomi is a genjutsu technique that allows Itachi to trap his opponent in a world of his own creation. In this world, he can manipulate time, space, and reality to torture his victim with horrifying visions. It is said to be the most powerful genjutsu in existence.</li></ul></li><li>Susanoo: Susanoo is a technique that manifests the user’s chakra into a giant humanoid avatar that surrounds them. It can be used for both offense and defense, as it can wield various weapons and shields. Itachi’s Susanoo had two special items: the Sword of Totsuka and the Yata Mirror.</li></ul><h2><span id=Itachi_Uchiha_Betrayal>Itachi Uchiha Betrayal</span></h2><p><strong>Uchiha betrayed his clan and his village by killing them all in one night, leaving only his brother Sasuke alive.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/een8jo53vqo.exactdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ita.jpg><p>He then joined the Akatsuki, a criminal organization that sought to capture the tailed beasts, including the Nine-Tails that was sealed inside <a href=#>Naruto Uzumaki.</a></p><p>However, Itachi’s betrayal was not what it seemed. He actually did it to protect Sasuke and Konoha from a greater threat.</p><p>Itachi learned that his clan was planning a coup d’etat against Konoha, which would lead to a civil war and a possible invasion by other villages.</p><p>He also wanted to prevent the revival of the Ten-Tails, a monstrous creature that was sealed inside the Uchiha ancestor, Madara Uchiha.</p><p>Itachi made a deal with the Konoha elders, who agreed to spare Sasuke’s life in exchange for Itachi’s loyalty and service.</p><p>He then slaughtered his clan in one night, with the help of Obito Uchiha, who posed as Madara Uchiha and manipulated him.</p><p>Itachi then confronted Sasuke and told him that he killed their clan to test his abilities and that he hated him. He also told him to live in hatred and seek revenge on him.</p><p>He then left Konoha and joined the Akatsuki, where he kept an eye on their activities and tried to stop them from harming Konoha.</p><p>Itachi’s true motive was revealed to Sasuke after his death, when he transferred his remaining power and memories to him through a crow that he had implanted in Naruto’s body.</p><p>He also apologized to Sasuke for everything he had done to him and asked him to forgive him.</p><p>He also told him that he always loved him and that he was proud of him.</p><h2><span id=Itachi_Uchiha_Quotes>Itachi Uchiha Quotes</span></h2><p>Uchiha was a man of few words, but when he spoke, he often said profound and memorable things.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/een8jo53vqo.exactdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/itachii.jpg><p>Here are some of his quotes:</p><ul><li>“People live their lives bound by what they accept as correct and true. That’s how they define reality. But what does it mean to be correct or true? Merely vague concepts… Their reality may all be a mirage. Can we consider them to simply be living in their own world, shaped by their beliefs?”</li><li>“Those who cannot acknowledge themselves will eventually fail.”</li><li>“The ones who aren’t able to acknowledge their own selves are bound to fail.”</li><li>“You don’t become a Hokage in order to be acknowledged by everyone. The one who is acknowledged by everyone becomes the Hokage.”</li><li>“Self-sacrifice… A nameless shinobi who protects peace within its shadow… That is a true shinobi.”</li><li>“You and I are flesh and blood. I’m always going to be there for you, even if it’s only as an obstacle for you to overcome. Even if you do hate me. That’s what big brothers are for.”</li><li>“Forgive me, Sasuke… There won’t be a next time…”</li></ul><h2><span id=Itachi_Uchiha_Five_Facts>Itachi Uchiha Five Facts</span></h2><p>Here are five facts about Itachi Uchiha that you may not know:</p><ul><li>Itachi was named after Itachi Uchiha, a legendary ninja from the novel The Tale of the Gallant Jiraiya (児雷也豪傑物語), which was one of Jiraiya’s favorite books.</li><li>Itachi’s favorite foods were cabbage and onigiri with seaweed in it, while his least favorite was steak.</li><li>Itachi had a hobby of visiting traditional Japanese cafes and enjoyed drinking green tea.</li><li>Itachi’s most used word was “fool” (馬鹿), which he often said to Kisame or Sasuke.</li><li>Itachi’s childhood dream was to become Hokage and make his father proud of him.</li></ul><h4><span id=ALSO_READ_Deepest_Pool_In_The_World>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Deepest Pool In The World</a></span></h4><p>https://youtu.be/Xo_nioC5cQ4</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmibnq6urMHNnaBnm5%2BifKrAwJyfomWlmLWqtMBmp6unlp65pnnPqK6eqqNir7O706Gcq2WSmsGzrdiao2aekZjBtHs%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fitachi-uchiha-profile-powers-brother-betrayal-facts.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fitachi-uchiha-profile-powers-brother-betrayal-facts.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fitachi-uchiha-profile-powers-brother-betrayal-facts.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fitachi-uchiha-profile-powers-brother-betrayal-facts.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fitachi-uchiha-profile-powers-brother-betrayal-facts.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fitachi-uchiha-profile-powers-brother-betrayal-facts.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./johnny-simmons-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./johnny-simmons-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography.html>Johnny Simmons Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./happy-diwali-2021-meaning-wishes-messages-greetings-images-quotes-cards.html>Happy Diwali 2021: meaning, wishes, messages, greetings, images, quotes, cards</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./happy-diwali-2021-meaning-wishes-messages-greetings-images-quotes-cards.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
