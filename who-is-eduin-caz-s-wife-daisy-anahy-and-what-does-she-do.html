She revealed she dated Eduin in <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">2019 </a>when Grupo Firme visited Ciudad Juárez.</p><p class=align-left>Stephanie claimed she was unaware the singer was married and that she was only coming forward not to destroy his marriage but support Lizeth. Unlike Lizeth, Stephanie provided strong evidence about the two linking up.</p><p class=align-left>In response, Caz revealed he had already addressed it with his wife. He further added that Stephanie had been blackmailing him. Soon after, a transgender woman named Dailine revealed on the show <i>Dailine lives in Tijuana</i> that she dated the father of two for over two years.</p><h3>Are Eduin Caz and Daisy Anahy still together?</h3><p class=align-left>Despite all these allegations, Daisy stuck with her husband and never publicly addressed them.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/e87b8a0830e364ef.jpg><p class=align-left>However, in June 2022, rumours about their marriage crumbling made rounds on social media after social media influencer Holy Milk claimed the two had separated.
