Today, many of Hollywood’s top stars are left-handed but is popular comedy star Seth Rogen among them?</p><p><strong>Seth Rogen is left-handed, as seen in his many film roles and his autograph signings. There are also paparazzi photos of him carrying his dog through an airport in a bag that he carries on his left shoulder, along with many other examples of him holding things with his left hand.</strong></p><p>For more on the conclusive evidence that Seth Rogen is left-handed, keep reading.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Left Handed</h2><p>The easiest way to ascertain whether a celebrity is right or left-handed is to look at photographs of them, particularly those of them signing autographs.</p><p>While many people display some degree of being ambidextrous, able to complete basic tasks with either hand, it’s very rare that they will be capable of writing competently with both hands.</p><p>In the case of Seth Rogen, we can see that he performs delicate tasks, particularly writing, with his left hand. There are countless photos of him <a href=# rel=noopener>signing his autograph with his left hand</a>, which is probably all the evidence we need to conclude that he is, in fact, left-handed.</p><p>There is also a paparazzi photograph of <a href=# rel=noopener>Rogen carrying his dog</a>, Zelda, through an airport in a bag that he carries on his left shoulder.</p><p>Zelda, a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel, featured in a photoshoot alongside Seth and his wife, Lauren, when they were <a href=# rel=noopener>interviewed by Haute Living</a>. The couple and their furry family member all looked equally smart in their evening wear.</p><p>Zelda shares her name with the titular princess from the Legend of Zelda games by Nintendo (Rogen is a keen retro videogamer). Given the precious cargo and how adorable Zelda is, it’s difficult to believe that Seth Rogen would dare to carry her in his weaker arm.</p><p>There are also photos of <a href=# rel=noopener>Rogen taking Zelda for a walk</a>, holding her leash with his left hand.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Further Evidence</h2><p>There are other examples of Rogen holding things with his left hand. In November 2015, Rogen posted a Twitter selfie of himself <a href=# rel=noopener>holding an action figure of rapper Travis Scott</a>. Rogen is holding the figure in his left hand and taking the selfie with his right hand.</p><p>At first glance, this makes it seem as though Rogen is holding the figure in his left, dominant hand. However, it’s also possible that the selfie was mirrored, due to Rogen taking the photo with his cellphone’s selfie camera.</p><p>In reality, Rogen might have been holding the figure in his right, less dominant hand, and operating his cellphone with his left hand, which is consistent with him being left-handed.</p><p>Another photo of Rogen holding something left-handed can be seen in his <a href=# rel=noopener>July 2019 interview with GQ</a>. The article includes a photo of Seth holding a desktop fan in his left hand and aiming it at his face. The fan, which looks to be substantial, is probably quite heavy, so it’s safe to assume that Rogen is holding the object in his stronger hand, in this case, his left.</p><p>Rogen starred in a <a href=# rel=noopener>2016 Super Bowl ad</a> alongside fellow comic Amy Schumer, promoting Bud Light.</p><p>In the politically themed campaign, Seth and Amy stand at a podium and give a speech in support of the Bud Light Party. Rogen is holding a bottle of Bud Light, which he holds in his left hand, as opposed to Schumer, who holds it in her right.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>There are many more examples of Rogen holding objects or operating devices with his left hand. You only need to look through his extensive filmography to see them.</p><p>While there are likely also examples of him holding things with his right hand, the evidence is heavily skewed towards him being a southpaw. We’re comfortable saying that Seth Rogen is left-handed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo63NrK6eqqNjsLC5jqKqZquVqbVuvs6gnKdlnJqztXnHmqWdnZRk</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fis-seth-rogen-left-handed.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fis-seth-rogen-left-handed.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fis-seth-rogen-left-handed.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fis-seth-rogen-left-handed.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fis-seth-rogen-left-handed.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fis-seth-rogen-left-handed.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./jared-leto.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./jared-leto.html>Jared Leto</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./alexa-demie-boyfriend-sister-mother-father.html>Alexa Demie Boyfriend, Sister, Mother, Father</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./alexa-demie-boyfriend-sister-mother-father.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
