Beyond being the wife of the disgraced actor and comedian, there are many more things of interest about her.</p><h3><strong>Summary of Alix Bailey’s Bio</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Full name:</strong> Alix Bailey</li><li><strong>Gender</strong>: Female</li><li><strong>Date of birth</strong>: February 3, 1967</li><li><strong>Alix Bailey’s Age</strong>: 56 years old</li><li><strong>Ethnicity</strong>: White</li><li><strong>Nationality</strong>: American</li><li><strong>Zodiac</strong> <strong>Sign</strong>: Aquarius</li><li><strong>Sexual Orientation</strong>: Straight</li><li><strong>Religion</strong>: Christianity</li><li><strong>Marital</strong> <strong>Status</strong>: Divorced</li><li><strong>Alix Bailey’s Husband</strong>: Louis C.K (Ex-husband)</li><li><strong>Alix Bailey’s Children</strong>: Kitty Szekely and Mary Louise Szekely.</li><li><strong>Alis Baily’s Parents</strong>: William Bailey and Sandra Stone Bailey</li><li><strong>Sibling:</strong> Ford Bailey</li><li><strong>Famous for</strong>: Being the ex-wife of Louis C.K.</li></ul><h2><strong>How Old is Alix Baily Today?&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Alix Bailey is currently 56 years old, as she was born in the United States on February 3, 1967. She was brought up by her parents, William Bailey and Sandra Stone Bailey, both of whom were painters. The duo managed to influence their daughter to love the creative arts, and she also became a painter. The actress had a great childhood and was raised in the United States and Italy together with a brother, Ford Bailey.</p><p>While there is no information as regards her high school education, the actress and painter, who is of American nationality and white ethnicity, got her education from Bennington College, where she studied painting. From there, she went to Indiana University, where she obtained an MFA.</p><p>She began her career as a painter when she was very young, and then in 1997, she had her first group exhibition in Italy. The next was in the United States in 1999. Thus far, she has had more than 20 group exhibitions. Her first solo Exhibition did not happen until 2012; after that, she had at least 5 more.</p><h2><strong>Louis C. K. and Alix Bailey Met When They Were 18</strong></h2><p>The love story between CK Louis and Alix Bailey is one that started in the 1980s. Specifically, the pair met for the first time in 1986 in Boston during the New Year’s Eve party. Very drunk at the time, Louis proposed to Alix, eliciting laughter from everyone around.</p><h3><strong>She Became&nbsp;Louis C.K’s Wife in 1998</strong></h3><p>Their next meeting would be almost 10 years later, and this time around, Louis was not drunk. The meeting was through a mutual friend. Alix fell in love with Louis, whom she dated for a number of years, and then they married in 1995.</p><p>At the time of their marriage, Louis, who had started his career in the entertainment business in 1984, was already making a name for himself. He was writing for many comedians, including Chris Rock and <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Conan O’Brien</a>. That said, his real breakthrough came just three years after his marriage when his works got recognized for awards such as the Primetime Emmy Awards for The Chris Rock Show and two Film Festival Awards for Tomorrow Night in 1998.</p><p>Louis was not the only one who saw gains in his career shortly after their marriage. Alix got her first acting role in 1998 when she appeared in Tomorrow Night. In 1999, she was on Late Night with Conan O’Brien, and then in 2006, she was in Searching for Nixon, which was her last work.</p><h2><strong>Alix Bailey and Louis CK Got Divorced in 2008</strong></h2><p>Although the marriage seemed to have made some things possible for him, and it seemed to be a happy one for more than a decade, during which they welcomed two amazing kids, it later ended in 2008 when their divorce was finalized. They were married for 13 years.</p><p>Unlike many other celebrity divorces, Alix and Louis kept their divorce very quiet. They did not make any headlines through accusations or any public demands. The only thing that was heard from them in relation to the demise of the marriage was that they had not been making each other happy for some time.</p><h2><strong>Their Marriage Produced Two Kids</strong></h2><p>The short-lived marriage was blessed with two daughters, Kitty Szekely, who is the older, and Mary Louise Szekely. Kitty was born Katherine Szekely on March 22, 2002, which means she is now 21 years old. She was born in Massachusetts, the United States, which is also where she was brought up.</p><p>While her career path has not been revealed, it is claimed that she has also done some paintings, but it is not known if she will follow her mother’s path. She has not shown any interest in going into entertainment, or at least not publicly.</p><p>The couple’s second child, Mary Louise Szekely, was born in 2005. Now 18 years old, she was only 3 when the marriage of her parents came to an end. Both Mary and her older sister remained mostly with their mother, even though they still had their father in their lives since Alix and Louis had<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external> joint custody of the girls</a>.</p><p>Like her older sister, Mary has also kept herself away from the media. Hence, nothing is known about her educational pursuits. Mary Louise Szekely doesn’t seem to be interested in acting, and there is nothing to suggest the career path she may want to take.</p><h2><strong>Where Is Alix Bailey Now?</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzzsouthafrica.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2023/06/Alix-Bailey-1-e1686797643531.jpg><p>After her divorce, Alix has decided to remain and concentrate more on her daughters and her work. Because of this, she has not gotten married a second time and has not made any statement on whether she is considering it. Living in New York, she spends most of her time painting.</p><p>She revealed that she now spends almost <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>all her time painting</a> except for when she wants to cook for her daughters or steal some time away for an hour or two. It is unsurprising that apart from the two exhibitions she had in 1997 and 1998, all her other exhibitions adding up to over 30, came after she was divorced. She is a member of The Painting Center in New York.</p><p>On his part, Louis has also not gotten married since the divorce, but he has been linked to a couple of women in the past. There was the claim in 2018 that he got into a relationship with Blanche Gardin, but it did not last a long time before they went their separate ways. In 2022, there were rumors that he was in a relationship with Belarusian actress Dasha Nekraskova.</p><p>IN 2017 during the MeToo movement, Louis C.K. was accused by several women of molesting them. Some of the allegations dated back to 2002, when he was still married to Alix. In that year, Dana Min Goodman and Julia Wolov, who had just got to perform at the U.S Comedy Arts Festival in Aspen, alleged the comedian invited them to hang out in his hotel room, where he exposed himself before masturbating. Others, including Abby Schachner and Rebecca Corry, accused him of something similar.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapa%2FHtLvUrZ%2BanqKesKJ6wqikaK2jZK6ttddmmZqhnJrGbrXNrZyrnaOptq%2BzjJ2crZmZocBurcGorK1lnKTCqr%2BMnKJmnahixKqyxGg%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2falix-bailey-interesting-details-about-louis-ck-s-ex-wife.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2falix-bailey-interesting-details-about-louis-ck-s-ex-wife.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2falix-bailey-interesting-details-about-louis-ck-s-ex-wife.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2falix-bailey-interesting-details-about-louis-ck-s-ex-wife.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2falix-bailey-interesting-details-about-louis-ck-s-ex-wife.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2falix-bailey-interesting-details-about-louis-ck-s-ex-wife.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./dr-oz-responds-after-people-call-for-his-resignation-but-receives-more-backlash.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./dr-oz-responds-after-people-call-for-his-resignation-but-receives-more-backlash.html>Dr. Oz Responds After People Call For His Resignation, But Receives More Backlash</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./what-s-new-on-disney-plus-in-december-2022.html>Whats new on Disney Plus in December 2022!</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./what-s-new-on-disney-plus-in-december-2022.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
