<time>04 Jul 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>If you were coming of age in the 1990s, there's a strong chance that one of your first celebrity crushes was <strong>Devon Sawa</strong>. The young actor's roles in Casper, Little Giants, Now and Then, Idle Hands, and, later, Final Destination cemented his <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>teen heartthrob</a> status. But his popularity also led him to rebel in order to break away from it all. Speaking of <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>his career slowdown</a> in the late '00s, Sawa told The Independent in 2022, "It wasn't completely my choice to take the break. I was burnt out, I was drinking too much. I was partying too much." Luckily for his fans, the former child star got through the tough time and is active in the business again. In fact, he's received a lot of positive attention for two recent roles. Read on to find out more about the now-43-year-old's life today.</p><p><strong>READ THIS NEXT:&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>See '90s Teen Idol Rider Strong Now at 42</a>.</strong></p><p>Fans still reach out to Sawa on social media to tell him how much they love him in the movies from his early career, including the live-action 1995 comics adaptation, Casper. But he found it difficult to make the transition into being taken more seriously as an adult actor, despite winning roles in less wholesome movies, including Idle Hands&nbsp;and&nbsp;Final Destination. "I had to smoke pot in movies and I had to be in a hip-hop video," Sawa told The Independent, referring to his appearance as the title character in the 2000 video for <strong>Eminem</strong><strong>'s </strong>song "Stan." That's what I felt like I had to do to get away from 'Can I keep you?'" That's the most beloved line from his scene with&nbsp;<strong>Christina Ricci&nbsp;</strong>in&nbsp;Casper, which many fans hold dear.</p><p>Sawa also explained to the outlet what helped him escape his rut and come to terms with his reputation. "And so I went back to Vancouver and got sober," he said of giving up his partying days. "After a couple of years, I met my wife and we went away to southeast Asia. I wrestled with the idea of never acting again. I had started doing a little bit of real estate in Vancouver. I bought a little old building and started to renovate it myself."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Devon-Sawa-in-2011.jpg><p>When he did return to Hollywood, Sawa took on several roles in independent movies before joining the cast of Nikita in 2010 and staying on the show until it went off the air in 2013. In 2017, he played Nico in the series Somewhere Between, and, over the last few years, has done episodes of Hawaii Five-0, MacGyver, and Magnum P.I.&nbsp;He's also appeared in movies including The Fanatic, Hunter Hunter, and Gasoline Alley. Right now, he's a recurring cast member on the well-received TV version of the horror franchise Chucky, which is coming back for a second season. And he thrilled fans by recently showing up in the HBO comedy Hacks, playing a younger man&nbsp;who helps <strong>Jean Smart's</strong> character get her groove back. Some TV critics even predicted that he'd score <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>a Guest Actor Emmy nomination</a> for the role.</p><p><strong>For more celebrity updates sent right to your inbox,&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>sign up for our daily newsletter</a>.</strong><span aria-hidden=true>ae0fcc31ae342fd3a1346ebb1f342fcb</span></p><p>Sawa married his wife, <strong>Dawni Sahanovitch</strong>, who is a producer, in 2013, and the couple have two kids: a son, <strong>Hudson</strong>, born in 2014, and a daughter, <strong>Scarlett</strong>, born in 2016. When his daughter was born, the&nbsp;Chucky&nbsp;actor&nbsp;told People, ​​"My wife Dawni and I welcome <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>a beautiful little girl</a> into the world—our daughter. Please say prayers that she is quiet and calm… Unlike my son, who would shoot himself out of a cannon if we let him."</p><p>Sawa has tried to share his work with his kids—with differing results. In 2021, he told Us Weekly&nbsp;that his son was "confused" to <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>see his father looking so young</a> in Casper. As for just the trailer for&nbsp;Chucky? "[T]hey're not having it," the actor said. "I gave it a shot! They weren't having the Chucky show, so I don't think there'll be watching that either."</p><p><strong>READ THIS NEXT:&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>See Former Child Star Haley Joel Osment Now at 34</a>.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Devon-Sawa-in-2021.jpg><p>In an interview with&nbsp;Collider this year, Sawa talked about the process of <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>auditioning for&nbsp;Hacks</a>, and how—in the age of COVID—most auditions happen by an actor filming themselves doing a scene and then sending it off, rather than having to show up to read the scene in person. The actor also said that, because of his level of fame post-Casper, he usually didn't have to audition for projects as a kid and got out of the habit.</p><p>"All I could think about was wanting to leave the room," he said of a terrible audition experience he had after his acting hiatus. "I don't even remember the audition. I just wanted to leave. It was horrible. It was a horrible experience." Sawa added, "I was thinking, 'But this is not how it's gonna be on set. I've been on set. It's a lot different from this big room with all these suits, who are not laughing at the right things and who are just eating.' I didn't get that job, by the way, after all that."</p><p>But, despite not being the quintessential LA actor who Sawa describes as knowing how to schmooze all the casting agents, he's forged an adult career that he loves. "Listen, I'm on Hacks and I'm on Chucky," he told the site. "I'm a happy guy. I really, really truly am."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmialajBrbXFnqanpJmjsm%2BvzqZmnZ2mpLtuv8CwmGamn6x6r7HWrGY%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fsee-90s-teen-idol-devon-sawa-now-at-43-best-life.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fsee-90s-teen-idol-devon-sawa-now-at-43-best-life.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fsee-90s-teen-idol-devon-sawa-now-at-43-best-life.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fsee-90s-teen-idol-devon-sawa-now-at-43-best-life.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fsee-90s-teen-idol-devon-sawa-now-at-43-best-life.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fsee-90s-teen-idol-devon-sawa-now-at-43-best-life.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./tiktok-video-of-lit-grade-r-graduation-party-gives-mzansi-the-feels-well-done-teachers.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./tiktok-video-of-lit-grade-r-graduation-party-gives-mzansi-the-feels-well-done-teachers.html>TikTok Video of Lit Grade R Graduation Party Gives Mzansi the Feels: Well Done, Teachers</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./jake-paul-defeats-ryan-bourland-in-boxing-fight-via-1st-round-tko-news-scores-highlights-stats.html>Jake Paul Defeats Ryan Bourland in Boxing Fight via 1st Round TKO | News, Scores, Highlights, Stats,</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./jake-paul-defeats-ryan-bourland-in-boxing-fight-via-1st-round-tko-news-scores-highlights-stats.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
