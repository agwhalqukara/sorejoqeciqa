He was born on the 21st of August 1994 in Los Angeles, California. His nationality is American, and he belongs to the Caucasian ethnicity.</p><p>Corde’s father is a legendary American rapper who became prominent in 1992 after he featured in Dr. Dre’s debut single, Deep Cover. Two years later, in 1994, Snoop released his quadruple-platinum debut album, Doggystyle. Since then, he has done numerous successful projects, releasing best-selling albums back to back.</p><p>Corde’s father has sold over 50 million records and won numerous awards over the course of his career. Corde’s mother, Shante Taylor, is a business executive, music manager, designer, and entrepreneur.</p><p>Shante Taylor has managed her husband Snoop Dogg’s music career from the early days. She manages all aspects of his businesses, including his cannabis line, music, touring, TV, and films. Furthermore, Shante runs Boss Lady Entertainment and is also a designer and the brain behind Broadus Collection, a brand of scarves she launched with her entire family.</p><h3><strong>How Many Siblings Does Corde Broadus Have?</strong></h3><p>Corde has three siblings, and they are Cordell, Cori, and half-brother Julian Broadus. Cordel, his immediate younger brother, played high school football and got a college scholarship. However, he did not make it to the professional level and is now a model and business executive.</p><p>Cori Broadus is Corde’s only sister, born on 22nd June 1999. Similarly, Cori has followed in her father’s footsteps in music and has so far released a handful of tracks as an indie artist.</p><p>Julian Broadus, born in 1998, is a son Snoop Dogg had from his past relationship with a lady identified as Laurie Holmond. Just like Codell, Julian also played high school football but did not go into the NFL. He is now a real estate agent who oversees high-net-worth clients in Los Angeles.</p><h2><strong>Corde Broadus’s Musical Career was Influenced by His Father</strong></h2><p>Corde, alongside his siblings, spent their formative years in Los Angeles with their parents. They had a comfortable life thanks to their father’s successful career in the entertainment industry. However, the family sometime in 2004 encountered trouble times which resulted in their parents getting divorced after they cited irreconcilable differences.</p><p>At that time, Corde was only ten, and he and his siblings had to split their time between their mom for the next couple of years. Thankfully, their parents reconciled in January 2008 and renewed their vows. After their reconciliation, Corde and his siblings started again to live under the same roof, and Corde particularly became close to his dad.</p><p>Being close to his father, Corde was able to pick interest in some of his passions, including football and music. During his high school days, he played in special teams at Long Beach Poly and also continued in the same position after he moved to Diamond Bar High School. Snoop coached some of his son’s teams and encouraged him to become a quarterback, but Corde lost interest along the way.</p><p>Corde Broadus entirely abandoned his budding football career to focus on music, and today, he is a hip-hop/rap artist and is well-recognized in the scene. He said that his father was the one that inspired him to follow the path of music. While growing up, Snoop Dogg was used to taking Corde to the studio, where he developed an interest in music and started learning the ropes.</p><p>After graduating from high school in 2012, Corde Broadus decided not to further his education but pursue music. He raps under the name Kalvin Love and has released a couple of albums, including Two Trees (2019), 2020 (2021), and Kai (2020). Some of his singles are Good Day, Little Love, The Boys, and Terror, among others.</p><p>Although he is still an up-and-coming artist, Corde Broadus has been consistent and working hard towards making a name for himself in the music industry. He has also collaborated with some artists in the industry, like Planet Falcom and Big We$.</p><h2><strong>Snoop Dogg’s Son, Corde, Has Three Children From Two Different Women</strong></h2><p>Corde Broadus is a father of three lovely children. He is not yet married but has been in a relationship for some years now with Soraya Love, a Los Angeles-based fashion designer. It is not certain exactly how long the two have been together, but it is public knowledge that they have welcomed three children over time.</p><p>They had their first child in 2018; a daughter named Elleven. Their second child, a son named Kai, arrived in September 2019 but sadly passed on after ten days. Corde took to social media to mourn his son and stated that the little time they spent with him will always remain special to them.</p><p>Corde and his girlfriend Soraya Love welcomed their third child together, a son named Sky Love, on 21st February 2021.
