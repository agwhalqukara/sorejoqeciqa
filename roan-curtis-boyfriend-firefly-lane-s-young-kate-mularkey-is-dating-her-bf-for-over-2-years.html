<time>02 Oct 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>Hailing from Vancouver, British Columbia, <strong>Roan Curtis</strong> is an actress appearing in the new Netflix series Firefly Lane. With over a decade in the film making industry, Roan is getting a star-making role as young <strong>Kate Mularkey</strong> in the show. Get the details of her age, career, and especially her two years plus relationship with her boyfriend.</p><p>Roan Curtis was born <a href=# rel=noopener>on</a> 2 February 1997 in Vancouver, Canada to her parents. Roan was only nine years old when she was hired to appear in an episode of The L Word in 2007. Since then the actress has worked steadily with supporting and guest roles lining her <a href=# rel=noopener>credit</a> page on IMDb.</p><p>While a career is one thing, people tend to focus only on that one thing, without allowing themselves the luxury to fall in love. That is not the case for Roan Curtis however. She is currently in a relationship for over two years with her boyfriend whom she has known since 2014.</p><h2>Roan Curtis Boyfriend - Dating James R. Swalm for Over 2 Years</h2><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebsindepth.com/storage/2021/02/roan-curtis-boyfriend-2021.jpg alt=roan-curtis-boyfriend-2021 width=1280 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><strong>Roan Curtis is currently dating her boyfriend James R. Swalm. They have been together for more than 2 years.</strong><br><strong>Image Source: <a href=# rel=noopener>Roan Curtis Instagram</a></strong></p><p>The first interaction Roan Curtis and her boyfriend, <strong>James R. Swalm</strong> aka <strong>James Rittinger</strong>, had was on Facebook in 2014. James sent her a friend request on the social media site and proceeded to send her messages about her not accepting requests.</p><p>The message led to a hilarious exchange between the two which James screenshot and kept all these years. He <a href=# rel=noopener>posted</a> the conversion on his Instagram page, there was a message where Roan even threatened to call the police. While he does not share the top conversation, it is still funny how their first interaction started.</p><p>Roan appears to remember things a little differently because she wrote a long post about meeting her boyfriend for the first time. She was 17-years-old and the gist of her post seems to be how she fell in love right when they met for the very first time. While she explains she is not a love at first sight believer, the moment with her boyfriend James was exactly that.</p><p><strong>Also Read: <a href=# rel=bookmark>Abigail Cowen Boyfriend – Secret BF of Fate: The Winx Saga Actress</a></strong></p><p>If you follow Roan or her boyfriend James, you have probably seen multiple pictures of the couple together. Even the ones with their adopted cat Gremlin, everything gives the vibe that the lovebirds are happy and extremely in love. There are also "awe" inspiring captions that accompany the photos.</p><p>In celebrating their first anniversary together on 6 August 2019, James <a href=# rel=noopener>posted</a>, "<span>I wanted to show off some of my favorite photos of the young woman who tore my heart out of my chest like that priest guy from Temple of Doom. But in a good way. Less of a tear and more of a gentle cradle. I love her. She makes me so much better than I knew I could be."</span></p><p><strong>Recommended: <a href=# rel=bookmark>Ali Skovbye Boyfriend – Is the Firefly Lane Actress Currently in a Relationship With a BF?</a></strong></p><p>Roan also <a href=# rel=noopener>posted</a> during their second anniversary saying despite all the quirks she is totally infatuated with her boyfriend. Being quarantined together also seems to have aided in helping them deepen their relationship. Roan and her boyfriend James were also together during the Christmas period, wearing their matching sweatsuits.</p><p>It is probably a little hard to maintain a relationship, considering they are both working actors. But the beautiful couple is making it all work. It is almost their three years together this August, something Roan and her boyfriend James is looking forward to we imagine.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span><h2>Roan Curtis Plays Young Kate Mularkey in the Netflix Series Firefly Lane</h2><p></p><p>Firefly Lane is based on the book of the same name by acclaimed writer <strong>Kristin Hannah</strong>.
