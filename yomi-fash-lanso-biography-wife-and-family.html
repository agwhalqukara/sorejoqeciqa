Although there are claims that his real name is Oluyomi, he revealed his birth name as Oluwayomi Oluwarotimi Akanbi Lanso.</p><p>He hails from Ogun State in the South Western region of Nigeria. The actor led his early life away from fame and attention. Instead, he enjoyed the company of others and played local games called&nbsp;ten ten and boju boju among others.</p><p>In addition, he attended different schools at a young age, including Jibril Martin Grammar School in Iponri. He later headed to the University of Lagos, where he studied Business Management.</p><p>The actor also trained at the Independent Television Producers Association of Nigeria (ITPAN). There, he took a course in Film Directing and Production. He has attended seminars and has consistently studied the art of movies, which have helped in building his career over time.</p><h2><strong>Yomi Fash-Lanso’s Family</strong></h2><p>Yomi was born into a closely knitted family. His father was Mr. Alamu Olansosiwaju, and his mother was Mrs. Emmanuella Adedoyin Lanso (nee Fashola).</p><p>The actor has kept details of his parents private, but his mother was born in 1926 and died in 2015. He has also given tales about his father. He revealed that if he were to go back in time, he would call his father a comedian. This is due to his father’s comic prowess when the actor was growing up.</p><p>More about the actor’s father, Yomi revealed that he had never seen his father angry, and the deed would later help him raise his children better.</p><p>The actor grew up in a Christian home. He once shared how his family’s church pastor once <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>asked his father to sow</a> a seed with his newly purchased car. The actor’s father agreed to give the pastor the car key but stepped out of the church and went home to bring a spare key, which he used to drive the family back home.</p><p>Yomi Fash-Lanso had 5 siblings (three brothers and two sisters) who were the first people to expose him to movies by often taking him to the cinema.</p><h2><strong>Who is Yomi Fash-Lanso’s Wife?</strong></h2><p>Yomi Fash-Lanso is married to Adetutu George. He keeps details about her private but praises her for her contributions to his personal life, their children, and his career.</p><p>Fash Lanso’s wife understands her husband’s career as an actor. She is both a fan and a critique.</p><p>As the story goes, the couple first met at a phone booth. At the time, Adetutu was still in school, did not watch a lot of movies, and so did not know who he was. They would eventually get to talk and know each other more, even though Adetutu gave him the wrong address to her home.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzznigeria.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/my-images-696-×-392-px-14.jpg><p>Prior to the time the couple became married, Fash-Lanso <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>used to wear a fake wedding ring</a> to keep women off his back. When he eventually met a girl he was interested in, he would ask them out and lie that he was married and his wife was living abroad. Some agreed to date him, while others didn’t.</p><p>According to him, he started the tactics when he realized that many women he met at the time were interested in getting married. However, he did not feel ready.</p><h2><strong>Yomi Fash-Lanso’s Children</strong></h2><p>The Wura actor is a father of 3 boys. He first became a father in 2004, and the other 2 were born afterward.</p><p>The actor shares a very close bond with his young children but keeps them away from the spotlight. With his children, he is a firm believer in teaching them things about life through his actions and not only with words.</p><p>This pushes him to be disciplined and project himself as a good parent and teacher to them.</p><p>So far, Yomi’s children are not exactly tilting toward the movie industry as their father. Instead, he lets them move at their pace and also watch his movies. <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>Speaking about parenting</a>, the actor has also noted that his kids are smart.</p><h2><strong>Yomi Fash-Lanso’s Net Worth</strong></h2><p>Yomi Fash-Lanso has an estimated net worth of $1 million.
