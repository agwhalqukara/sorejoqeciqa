Offensive WAR: 14.6.&nbsp; Pitching WAR: 15.5.&nbsp; Here we come up with 72 wins.&nbsp; They won 80.&nbsp; This time, eight wins above WAR.&nbsp;</p><p>I’m not sure what to make of this quite yet, but it’s not looking good for the “sabers."&nbsp; This is where I started scratching my head and decided to take on the dreaded task of crunching the numbers for all teams.</p><img alt="DETROIT - SEPTEMBER 28: Asdrubal Cabrera #13 of the Cleveland Indians is congratulated by teammate Matt LaPorta #7 after scoring on a single to left center field off the bat of Jack Hannahan of the Detroit Tigers during the fifth inning of the game at Com" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static-assets.bleacherreport.net/img/atoms/lazyImage/logo.png itemprop=contentUrl thumbnail_url=https://cdn.bleacherreport.net/images_root/article/media_slots/photos/000/344/408/127533565_crop_340x234.jpg?1330080526 image=https://cdn.bleacherreport.net/images_root/article/media_slots/photos/000/344/408/127533565_crop_340x234.jpg?1330080526 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class=caption></span><span itemprop=citation class=credit>Leon Halip/Getty Images</span><p>Here’s what I came up with:</p><p>A full 21 teams’ actual records were within five wins of their total WAR calculation. Thirteen of them were within three wins, and five were pretty much dead-on.&nbsp; Only two teams were more than eight wins off: the aforementioned Red Sox and the <a href=#>Kansas City Royals</a>.</p><p>I decided to look at it another way.&nbsp; What if I totaled each team’s WAR values and then sorted them in order from highest to lowest within their division?&nbsp; Would the metric match up as effectively here?</p><p>This was really eye-opening.&nbsp; The team WAR calculation predicted positions within each division remarkably well.&nbsp; Only the <a href=#>Marlins</a>, Royals, Red Sox and <a href=#>Cubs</a> were out of position.&nbsp; In the case of the Red Sox and Cubs, the difference in position was determined by a variation of only one win. &nbsp;So WAR was able to compute a team’s divisional standing to within one or fewer wins in 28 out of 30 cases.</p><p>It’s important to remember here that since we only looked at the total WAR for each team, it doesn’t say a whole lot about its value at an individual player level. &nbsp;It also doesn’t answer the question about whether or not it is a good predictor of future performance.&nbsp; But then, no traditional statistic is a foolproof method for predicting the future.&nbsp; All stats are merely a measure of performance within certain parameters.</p><p>I also want to be clear that as I understand it, the concepts of “moneyball” and “sabermetrics” are not one and the same.&nbsp; Sabermetrics simply attempt to objectively measure a player’s effectiveness.&nbsp; Moneyball attempts to use sabermetrics to quantify a player’s monetary value within a set ideology.&nbsp; Perhaps confusion between the two contributes to the disagreement between “sabers” and “traditionalists."&nbsp; Perhaps it’s just representative of one group’s willingness to apply mathematical analysis to a subjective topic, and the other group’s opposition to having their beloved game reduced to a bunch of numbers.</p><img alt="BOSTON - APRIL 12: Jorge Posada #20 of the New York Yankees stands on the field with the standings on the scoreboard in the background before the game against the Boston Red Sox on April 12, 2008 at Fenway Park in Boston, Massachusetts.
