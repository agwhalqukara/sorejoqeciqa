She is the biological daughter of Gloria Abarca Villasenor, Vincente’s sister-in-law.</p><p>However, Fernandez and his wife Dona adopted Alejandra since they had three sons but no daughter of their own. Regarding the adoption of Alejandra, her adoptive father said,</p><p>“Alejandra is Gloria’s daughter, a sister of my wife. But since I didn’t have daughters… Alejandra’s story, she was, I don’t know, 40 days old, so it was my birthday, and I lived in Guadalajara, and they left the girl. Then I played with her until she got sleepy. So I put her in the crib and told her “go to sleep” and she fell asleep. With that, she beat me.”</p><p>Alejandra stayed with them and became a part of the family from that moment. She was the family’s youngest member and grew up with her three elder brothers. Undoubtedly, she is loved by all her family.</p><p>Alejandra’s biological mother wanted her daughter back when she was four. As per Vicente,</p><p>“She is my little girl to me, and there was a time when my sister-in-law took her from me. I would go to the farm and roar until she noticed that I was getting thinner. My sisters-in-law are like my sisters. Then she saw me suffer so much that she brought Alejandra back to me and told me to keep her.”</p><p>The Mexican beauty then graduated with a degree in fashion design. However, she had no idea that she was adopted until she was old enough to understand.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=-parents->Parents</h2><h3 class="kt-adv-heading_c263a3-de wp-block-kadence-advancedheading" data-kb-block=kb-adv-heading_c263a3-de>Vicente Fernández (Father)</h3><p>Alejandra’s father, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Vicente Fernandez</a>, was a Mexican singer, actor, and film producer.
